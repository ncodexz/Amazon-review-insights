# Amazon Review Insights

This project analyzes Amazon reviews using a multi-stage NLP pipeline to extract sentiment, group products into semantic categories, and generate high-level insights.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three independent but connected blocks:

### Block 1 – Sentiment Inference
- Applies a trained DistilBERT sentiment model to raw Amazon reviews
- Filters reviews without real user experience
- Produces a sentiment-enriched dataset
- This dataset is the single source of truth for downstream blocks

### Block 2 – Product Clustering
- Groups reviews by product (ASIN)
- Builds a representative text per product
- Uses sentence embeddings and unsupervised clustering
- Outputs a small number of semantic product categories

### Block 3 – Insights & Generation
- Aggregates reviews per product and per cluster
- Computes simple signals (review volume, negative ratio)
- Identifies top products and worst products per cluster
- Generates neutral summary articles using a language model

## How to Run

### Requirements

Install dependencies:


### Block 1 – Sentiment Dataset Builder

1. Place the raw dataset at:
data/raw/Movies_and_TV.jsonl

The dataset must contain at least the fields:
- `asin`
- `text`

2. Place the trained sentiment model at:
models/sentiment_model/


This directory should contain the files generated by:
- `trainer.save_model()`
- `tokenizer.save_pretrained()`

3. Run the script:
python src/block1_sentiment.py

This will generate:
data/processed/reviews_with_sentiment.jsonl

Each line contains:
- product ASIN
- review text
- predicted sentiment label
- sentiment probabilities

### Block 2 and Block 3

Blocks 2 and 3 consume the sentiment-enriched dataset generated by Block 1 and do not operate on the raw dataset directly.

## Design Notes

- The sentiment model is used only for inference, not training.
- Star ratings are not used in the final pipeline.
- All product rankings and decisions are computed before any generative model is used.
- The language model only rewrites structured insights and does not analyze data.
- The project prioritizes clarity, explainability, and modular design.

## Limitations

- The trained model weights are not included in the repository.
- Running the full pipeline requires access to the original dataset.
- The generation step depends on an external API.

## Future Work

- Automate model and dataset download
- Improve cluster labeling
- Add lightweight evaluation for generated summaries
